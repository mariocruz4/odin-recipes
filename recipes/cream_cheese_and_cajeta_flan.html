        <p>A slice of flan.</p>
        <p>For those who doesn't know what <em>cajeta</em> means, here it is:</p>
        <p><em>Cajeta</em> is a traditional Mexican candy, made mainly with goat's milk, which is characterized by being thick.</p>
        <p>The history of the <em>flan</em> 
            seems to be with Rome, and, essencialy is a dessert with sugar, milk and <strong>many</strong> egg yolks.</p>
